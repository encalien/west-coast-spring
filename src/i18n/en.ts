      //   "West Coast Swing or WCS is a modern partner dance. It evolved from lindy hop in the 1960s on the west coast of America.",
      //   "It is characterized by the elastic movement of the partners, which results from a specific technique of leading and following. The dance places a strong emphasis on the musical expression of both partners and is one of the few dances that encourages free dance improvisation.",
      //   "Since it is a relatively new dance, it continues to evolve year after year and stylistically adapts to the music to which it is danced. This is usually pop, hip hop, acoustic music and blues."

His innovative and diversified dance background encompasses styles like Lindy-Hop, Balboa, Charleston, Acrobatic rock'n'roll, Salsa, Boogie Woogie, and Tap dancing. He's been a Rock and Roll, Lindy Hop, and Charleston instructor since 2009.",

After high school, she chose to specialize in WCS and relocated to Switzerland, where she now lives and works at Jang Widler's dance school.",

Dance became a significant part of his life, and he dedicated numerous hours weekly to professional training.",

Recognising the distinct differences between ballroom and West Coast Swing, this dance became their passion, mostly because of its endless possibilities and freedom. They were unable to let competing go either, so after some years of competing, they both made it to the prestigious All - Star category.",
