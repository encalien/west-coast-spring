      description: [
        "West Coast Swing or WCS is a modern partner dance. It evolved from lindy hop in the 1960s on the west coast of America.",
        "It is characterized by the elastic movement of the partners, which results from a specific technique of leading and following. The dance places a strong emphasis on the musical expression of both partners and is one of the few dances that encourages free dance improvisation.",
        "Since it is a relatively new dance, it continues to evolve year after year and stylistically adapts to the music to which it is danced. This is usually pop, hip hop, acoustic music and blues."

          "Tschen found his way into dancing when he was 16 years old. Since then, it played a major part in his life.",

He was a part of a latin formation dance club in the northern parts of Germany for 5 years before he met West Coast Swing. Since then, everything else was just a dance, but West Coast Swing was his passion. He visited a lot of events, took privates with champions like Ben Morris, PJ Turner, Brandi Guild, Robert Royston, Cameo McHenry and many more.",
          "The wide variety of music, patterns, stylings, footworks, teamwork, musicality and freedom is what makes Tschen love WCS. He is constantly trying to get better and share his knowledge within his community in Erding, Germany, where he is currently teaching and living.",
